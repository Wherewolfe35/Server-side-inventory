# Server-side-inventory
Server Side Inventory

Tech: JQuery, Node, Express, AJAX

In this project we'll create a project that tracks an inventory on the server.

Base Mode:

The project will allow users to view items in the inventory, add items to the inventory, and search for items by name. Inventory items will be objects that are held in a server side array.

In your server.js handle each of the user verbs which will be hit via AJAX as follows:

view: GET, returns the full array of inventory
add: POST, receives a new object, adds it to the existing inventory
search: POST, receives a string that we'll check against existing objects in the inventory & returns an array of matches (hint: research the STRING.includes JS method)
